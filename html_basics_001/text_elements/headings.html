        joined Liberia in 1857. The most populous city in the county is Pleebo, with 22,963 residents,

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Maryland was first established as a colony of the Maryland State Colonization Society in 1834,
        but was not granted independence until 1854. The Maryland Society had played a pivotal role in 
        the formation of the larger American Colonization Society years before. Following a referendum in 
        1853, the colony declared its independence from the Colonization Society across the Atlantic Ocean 
        and formed the Republic of Maryland. It held the land along the south coast between the Grand Cess and 
        San Pedro Rivers.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Farming is the main economic activity in Maryland County, accounting for the employment of approximately 
        60% of residents. Rice and cassava are the main crops raised in the county. It is roughly estimated that 
        about 98% of the county's population is Christian, 1% Muslim, and 1% Animist.
        The flag of Maryland County consists of a drawing of a tree and a lighthouse on a cliff with a small 
        Liberian flag in the upper left corner.
        In 2007, WBAL-TV in Baltimore produced a documentary special titled Africa's Maryland, which focused 
        on this region and its cultural roots in the American state of Maryland.[8] After the documentary 
        aired, the state signed a sister state agreement with Bong and Maryland counties.</p>
