# Assignment Operators in Python are used to assign values to variables.
# The following code demonstrates the use of assignment operators in Python.
# Assignment operators include simple assignment, addition assignment, subtraction assignment, multiplication assignment, division assignment,
# modulus assignment, exponentiation assignment, and floor division assignment.
# The code below shows how these operators work with variables.
