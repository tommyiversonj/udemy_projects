# Bytearray Iteration is a process of traversing through each element in a bytearray object.
# A bytearray is a mutable sequence of bytes, which can be modified after creation.
# Bytearrays are useful when you need to manipulate binary data, such as reading and writing files,
# or when you need to perform operations on binary data that require mutability.
# Bytearrays can be created using the bytearray() constructor or by converting an existing bytes object.
# Bytearrays can be iterated over using a for loop, which allows you to access each byte in the bytearray.
# Bytearrays can also be sliced, concatenated, and modified in place.
