# Using bytes built-in function to create a bytes object
# The bytes built-in function can be used to create a bytes object from an iterable of integers
# or from a string with a specified encoding.
# The bytes object is immutable, meaning that once it is created, it cannot be modified.
# The bytes object is a sequence of bytes, which can be used to represent binary data.
# The bytes object is often used to represent binary data, such as images, audio files,and other types of binary files.
# The bytes object is also used to represent text data in a specific encoding, such as UTF-8 or ASCII.
